	The second argument to each function is the target format. Currently, the following formats are supported:
	
	    newick
	    nexus
	    nexml
	    phyloxml
	    cdao

	convert()
	
	Given two files (or handles) and two formats, both supported by Bio.Phylo, convert the first file from the first format to the second format, writing the output to the second file.
	
	Phylo.convert("example.nhx", "newick", "example2.nex", "nexus")
